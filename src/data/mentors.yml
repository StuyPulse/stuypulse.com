- name: Joe Blay
  image: /mentors/Blay.png
  description: Joe Blay has had a tremendous impact on our team since his high school years. Joe Blay was a former StuyPulse student, graduating in 2009. While a student, he was an engineer and the main driver. After graduating, he made sure to stay with the team, despite his time studying in Stony Brook University. After graduating, he has come back to Stuyvesant to teach as well as coach StuyPulse. He mentors every aspect of the team in one way or another trying to make sure that every department of 694 is constantly growing. His main strengths are engineering and strategy. During competitions, he works on the drive team, as the coach, setting up our match strategy and making sure the drivers are ready to play as well as making sure that the strategy team is gets us ready for every match and the elimination rounds.

- name: James Lonardo
  description: James Lonardo has ceaselessly served our team for over eight years. He is essentially the “backbone of our team”. As an attentive mentor, James organizes all medical, contact, and trip forms, and signs us up for events. Not only was he devoted to our team, he was also a FIRST advocate on the streets. He even organized a competition for robotics classes with members of the U. S. Coast Guard, which inspired many children within and outside of school. His supportive attitude and contribution is indispensable to our team.

- name: Tom Ferguson
  description: Tom Ferguson is an engineer with years of experience. He serves as Vice President of Mechanical Engineering at Cox and Co., the industry leader in aerospace design. He exhibits a polite personality and is a responsible leader. He has a will not of iron, but of aluminum honeycomb. And he is one of the most beloved and respected mentors of the Stuyvesant Robotics Team. Tom Ferguson has inspired generations of engineers on the team. Tom's deft understanding of many mathematical and physical concepts in engineering is invaluable to us when we design and build our robot. He encourages us to use abstract formulas and laws to determine concrete requirements and limitations in our designs

- name: Ron Kunicki
  image: /mentors/Ron_Kunicki.jpg
  description: Dedicated, resourceful, precise, compassionate, funny, - who is this mentor who never fails to show up to save the day? None other than engineer and “father of the team,” Ron Kunicki. Not only has his easygoing nature captured our hearts and minds, his dedication to FIRST has given him an essential role on our team. When asked why he was so committed, he replied, “With team 694, my mind continues to be entertained, and sometimes I even have to go home and research the problems the team asks me.” Whatever the reason, Ron's leadership and dedication have become a vital part of the team. Ron joined the team as a parent for his daughter Theo, who has graduated and is currently a student at MIT, yet he continues to return year after year.

- name: Jeanne Boyarsky
  image: /mentors/Jeanne_Boyarsky.jpg
  description: Jeanne Boyarsky has volunteered since 2010 as a Java programming mentor in addition to her volunteering at CodeRanch. She has not only provided invaluable guidance with code, but also has kept us organized, and helped lead us to our Innovation in Control award in 2010. Jeanne even found time to write three Java books (and mentioned 694 in all of them). She has also spoken at several conferences.

- name: Mel Hauptman
  description: Mel likes to shake things up. There is no point in the season where he isn't saying that something is wrong with the robot. This lack of satisfaction constantly keeps all of us on our toes. Mel continues to come to meetings every year to help make us improve year after year.

- name: Navid Kashem
  image: /mentors/Navid_Kashem.jpg
  description: He graduated from StuyPulse in 2019, and has left a deep impression on the legacy of this team. As a junior he served as the Vice President of Mechanical Engineering, and in his senior year, the President. Our team nominated him for the Dean's List Award for his dedication in his junior year in 2018, and he won the award at the NYC regional! He consistently utilizes this experience to provide insight and guidance to our Engineering team now. Like the present, his time in StuyPulse was not limited to a singular department as he continuously pushed for StuyPulse to internationalize itself as he worked with teams from Syria, Cyprus, Argentina, China, Chile, Canada, and Norway, helping increase the outreach of StuyPulse by tenfold. Stories about his complete disconnection from the mundane activities of sleeping and resting during competition are shared and laughed at as, even now, they remain applicable to him. “When thinking about StuyPulse, I’m always reminded of friends, family, joy, persistence, and beating every single obstacle in our way. StuyPulse is my life, and I wouldn’t change it for anything,” a quote said by Navid while he was on the team. Without Navid, StuyPulse would not be what we are today!

- name: Shelley Grant
  image: /mentors/Shelley_Grant.jpg
  description: Shelley has a personal connection with the team as her daughter was one of the original members of the team when it was first founded in 2000. Yet her role on the team is so much more than the parent of an alumna. She consistently provides assistance with anything and everything related to our team and serves as a mentor, a role model, and urges us to go above and beyond. Not only is she a business mentor, but she works on various awards (ex. Impact, Woodie Flowers, Dean's List) and outreach projects. Her actions are always in 694's best interests as she consistently reaches out to others to help build connections with our team. Without Shelley, 694's presence would be greatly diminished.

- name: Kevin Wang
  image: /mentors/Kevin_Wang.jpg
  description: Kevin Wang is a Stuypulse alumnus (‘13) and valuable mentor. Kevin attended the University of Illinois-Champaign (‘17), where he studied Computer Science. Kevin has had a longstanding commitment to Stuypulse, serving as our driver during his senior year and coming back to mentor the team in 2015. Kevin became involved with the team as a mentor again during the 2022 season and has become a vital part of the team’s community and support network since. Kevin works as a software engineer at Affirm, a San-Francisco based financial company. However, Kevin comes to every meeting to offer his knowledge and enthusiasm to the team; there has yet to be a day he hasn’t come in and stayed until the end. We couldn’t imagine Stuypulse without him. He’s constantly providing students with his guidance and maintains a welcoming, approachable aura that makes him easy to talk to.

- name: Faye Chan
  image: /mentors/Faye_Chan.jpg
  description: With her daughter being a former president of engineering on the team, Faye has been a long-time supporter of StuyPulse. She is always armed with some type of food; her love language is shoving all sorts of brownies and cookies into our arms during competitions and events. During events, she can likely be found dishing out generous portions of snacks and homemade onigiri. Faye brings out her creative side to craft the next big hit for team merchandise. With her generosity and enthusiasm, Faye is a role model for the team.

- name: Pev Vail
  image: /mentors/Pev_Vail.jpg
  description: Pev is currently a mechanical engineering student at Yale University. However, he still dedicates much of his time to robotics. He not only takes the time to review our CAD and give us suggestions, he also makes the 3 hour commute to come see us when he has a break from school. He also makes an effort to go to every competition we do, helping out with both strategy and in the pit. He also continuously makes an effort to help out PulseCrew, our group of students that help out other teams at competitions. In 2023, he co-drive coached our offseason robot, Sacrod, during Brunswick Eruption and RoboReply. You can often find him volunteering as an Robot Inspector.
