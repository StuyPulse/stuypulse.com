Excelsior is our soul and pride. Despite our team being largely left inexperienced during the pandemic, our performance went above and beyond: placing 3rd seed in the Galileo Division and winning 2 Regionals. In this season, the blessing was not only in our awesome robot, but also in our extraordinarily versatile community.
