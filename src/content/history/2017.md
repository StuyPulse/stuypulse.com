Our 2017 robot, Rafael, was named in honor of our now retired coach Rafael Colón by our top sponsor, the Stuyvesant High School Parent’s Association. Rafael was one of the most consistent robots that we have built so far, and although there were occasional problems, Rafael took us all the way to quarterfinals at the South Florida Regional, where we won the Chairman’s Award. We were also finalists at the New York City Regional, where we won the Entrepreneurship Award. Rafael even made it all the way to the Daly Division of the St. Louis Championships. Rafael completed his season after making a trip to China along with team members to participate in the China Robotics Challenge, and made it to semifinals.
