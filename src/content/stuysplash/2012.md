  - title: Introduction to Drive Trains
    presenter: Joanna Zhu
    description: "We will discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of various commonly used drivetrains, as well as how to assemble the Kitbot on Steroids (from Simbotics Team 1114)."

  - title: Robot Programming with Java
    presenter: Kevin Wang
    description: "An introduction to WPILibJ and command-based programming (CBP). In this presentation, we will write a basic robot project using WPILibJ. Note: we will not be teaching the Java language itself in this talk; prior experience with the language and object-oriented programming is strongly recommended."

  - title: Introduction to Control Theory
    presenter: Dan Lavin (Mentor)
    description: "We will cover the fundamentals of control theory including PID control."

  - title: Java Beta Presentation
    presenter: Eric Lam
    description: "We will discuss the 2013 FRC Java beta test. Topics will include the slightly newer code, but more importantly RobotBuilder and LiveWindow, the former helping create the framework for a CBP project, the latter aiding in debugging robots, as well as allowing for (interesting) cosmetic additions."

  - title: Version Control with Git
    presenter: Kevin Wang
    description: "We will discuss the concept of version control and its importance to large software projects, and we will explore the distributed version control system Git and how it facilitates collaborative robot code development. Basic knowledge of the Linux command-line interface is recommended."

  - title: Motors In Depth
    presenter: Dan Lavin (Mentor)
    description: "We will be learning about the physics behind the contraptions we know as “motors” and about the physics that makes them run and make our robot do what we need it to do."

  - title: Fundraising
    presenter: Naoki Cho
    description: "We will discuss both conventional and nonconventional methods of securing funding, from book sales to grants."

  - title: Introduction to Manipulators
    presenter: Jason Ye
    description: "We will introduce different types of game piece manipulators and some general design ideas for reference and for inspiration."

  - title: Effective FIRST Strategies
    presenter: Peter Jasko
    description: "A presentation/lecture of game playing and scouting strategies that have proven to be effective for FRC teams. This presentation will contain examples and concepts that can give your team an edge when it comes to competition."

  - title: Team Management
    presenter: Philipp Steinmann
    description: "We will explore how effective team administration can be facilitated by optimizing workflows and utilizing innovative, modern techniques."

  - title: Scouting and Conceptual Design Flaws
    presenter: Sebastian Conybeare
    description: "We will identify “obvious” design errors from a strategist's perspective, and how to avoid them. You will also learn about scouting, how to make it effective, how to use that information, and how to win with just a boxbot."

  - title: Robot Electronics
    presenter: Samuel Lijin
    description: "We will begin with a brief overview of the current FRC control system and then proceed to discuss tips of the trade, including effective tools, recommended wiring configurations, and a brief overview of troubleshooting procedures, followed by what's new in 2013."

  - title: Animation and CGI
    presenter: Alex Pan
    description: "We will discuss how to manipulate simple 3D geometric figures to create a vast variety of objects and shapes and learn how to apply textures, lighting, and other properties to imbue our creations with life. By the end of the workshop, you will have gained a solid understanding of how to use the same CGI used to make games, movies and advertisements"

In 2012 we held Stuy Splash at the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn on December 15th. Below are the presentations from the event.
