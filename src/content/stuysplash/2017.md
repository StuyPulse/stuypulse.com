  - title: Steering a Ship that No One Taught You How to Pilot
    presenter: Noah Tom-Wong
    description: "Leadership is the most important part of a well-run team, and yet you never really learn about it. This lecture goes over leadership structure and should help you run a team effectively. It covers topics such as delegation, scheduling, and communication so that your robot-building experiences goes as smoothly as possible."

    description: "Code and scripts written for PCs run on top of an operating system, where drivers and the kernel hide the complexity of the hardware layer. By writing code that compiles and runs directly on a chip with no OS present, you can unlock some neat features that may help you achieve your design goals. We’ll quickly go over the basics of microcontroller programming with best practices and example use cases, and go through a short demo on setting up a microcontroller programming environment."
  - title: Top 8 Mistakes to Avoid as a FRC team
