        Our nickname is derived from the
        idea that we are at the heart of our student body and local community.
        Our goal is to incentivize STEM ideas and cultivate skills in
        engineering, programming, business, teamwork, and leadership through our
        participation in FIRST Robotics Competitions. We hope to serve as an
        inspiration for people in our community and educate them on the wonders
        of the scientific community while simultaneously giving back through
        various outreach events. Our priority is making sure that everyone even
        slightly interested in STEM has the chance to further explore their
        interests and develop skills that will allow them to succeed. We are a
        no-cut, no tryout, all inclusive team that strives to make it possible
        for all individuals to be a part of an accepting community that allows
        people to ______________________

      <h2 id="today" class="offset">Team 694 Today</h2>
      <p>
        Team 694 is made up of about 150 students and participates annually in
        the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). During our six-week build season,
        we work <strong>almost daily</strong> in our laboratory at Stuyvesant as
        our dedicated team members collaborate to design, construct, and program
        our competing robot with the help of gracious parents and volunteer mentors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to <strong>share our experience with teams in need</strong>.
        To this end we mentor teams and schools both in FRC, FIRSTTech, and
        FIRST Lego League, as well as performing street-level demos in our
        school. Our team is currently mentoring three new FLL teams, one of
        which we started ourselves at a nearby church. Furthermore, we also
        assist FRC teams during competitions with PulseCrew, which is made up of
        a group of experienced students dedicated to helping others with any
        Software or Engineering issues they may encounter. When we hosted our
        lab's grand opening in December 2022, we demoed our robot for various
        members of our school's staff as well as <strong>Councilmember Marte</strong>
        and <strong>Senator Brian Kavanagh</strong>. We have also reached out
        to Marte with intentions of testifying at an education committee to
        advocate for increased STEM funding for afterschool programs around the
        state, and have multiple planned robot demos for the Spring “inviting
        local politicians to the exciting competitions.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Team 694's impact lasts not only in our local community, but also
        intrinsically, within our team's community. We have a <strong>100%</strong>
        graduation rate, with most being accepted to some of the <strong>best
        universities in the world</strong>. To help perpetuate this high standard,
        we all help to drive one another to do better in school and help each other
        out when aid is needed.

      <h2>StuyPulse's Beginnings</h2>
      <p>Our team was founded in the fall of 2000 by a group of students and parents
        who were ready to take on the formidable task of building our first robot.
        They shared a common interest in robotics, and although few on the team had
        known each other prior to forming the team, they quickly learned the importance
        of cooperation and teamwork, and used it to accumulate the team members,
        sponsors, and mentors we have today., From the moment we raised funds for the
        daunting entrance fees to the FIRST competition, we were destined to succeed:
        eventually scoring highest in our division at the Champtionship Event.</p>

      <h2>What makes StuyPulse unique?</h2>
      <p>One of the things that Team 694 takes pride in is our overwhelming diversity.
        About forty percent of our team identifies as female, more than fifty percent
        qualifies for free and/or reduced lunch, and over eighty percent of our team
        are first generation Americans.</p>
      <p>Our team maintains close-knit relationships with one another despite the sheer
        number of members we have. Bonding occurs naturally, yet events such as our team
        dinner and honorary birthday mentions help speed this up! The journey to regionals
        across the country is anything but boring and is kept close to our hearts.</p>
      <p>As a team, StuyPulse has gone on to be champions numerous times. Last year,
        we went to win the third seed in the Galileo Division after captaining the
        third alliance. However in 2016 we won both regional champions and the Engineering
        Inspiration Award at the NYC Regional, and were the sub-division champions of the
        Curie Subdivision at World Championships. We won the Regional Chairman's Award
        at the South Florida Regional and the Entrepreneurship Award at the New York
        City Regional in 2017. </p>
