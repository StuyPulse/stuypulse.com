      Engineering is responsible for designing and building the robot. Every
      build season, Engineering divides up into smaller groups consisting of 4-6
      students, at least one of whom is a veteran member. These groups focus on
      individual parts of the robot such as the drive train, electronics and
      mechanisms. There is often more than one mechanism group either focusing
      on different parts of the robot, or competing against each other for the
      better design. To keep track of all these groups, we have a President and
      Vice President of Engineering. It is their job to make sure that all of
      engineering runs smoothly. We also have many directors, including the
      Primary Machinist, Director of Lab Operations and Safety, Director of
      Procurement, Director and Assistant Director of Electronics, Director and
      Assistant Director of Strategy, Director of Design, and Director of Field
      Construction. More information about these positions can be found <a

      The job of the programmers is to write software which controls the robot's
      logic and motion on the playing field, as well as to ensure that the
      electronic systems are running smoothly. Essentially, they breathe life
      into otherwise lifeless metal. The programming team is also responsible
      for making sure all of the old robots have working code so that they are
      prepared to perform for demonstrations. Because most incoming members
      having little or no programming experience, we take it upon ourselves to
      teach everyone to program using the Java language. Teaching a large group
      of students to program a robot is no easy task, given our painfully short
      time frame. The pressure and patience pays off, however, when we see our
      code being executed by a 120lb robot soaring across the field. Team 694
      also believes in open source software and the free distribution of our
      code to the greater community. All of our code is free for anyone to look
      at and learn from. Note: Some files may not be under the same open
      license, please check the comments of each file for specific licensing
      information. All of our code (past and present) is open source and
      available for viewing on <a

      >.

    <p>
      Our Business department has a very diverse list of responsibilities. It is
      in charge of fundraising, branding, logistical work like meals during
      build season and travel planning, award submissions, outreach as well as
      any other task that does not fall under the other departments. To make
      sure all these projects are running smoothly, we have a President and Vice
      President of Business. They are also responsible for being the primary
      contact for our sponsors. Our Director of Public Relations is responsible
      for coordinating all of our outreach efforts, which include mentoring FLL,
      FTC, and FRC teams as well as maintaining a strong presence on the media.
      Our Director of Finance maintains contact with sponsors and ensures the
      stability of the budget, and our Director of Operations helps out with the
      logistics of events and paperwork.
