    It all began in the spring of 2001 when Team 694 gave a presentation about
    instituting a robotics curriculum to interested teachers. Since then, we
    have helped inspire several schools to get involved in this spectacular
    program. In addition, Team 694 has been there to lend a helping hand by
    mentoring teams, especially I.S. 89 across the street whom we have mentored
    each year since 2002.

    Our involvement with FLL increased in December 2005 when the Manhattan
    Borough FLL Tournament was first held in our school. After last year's
    successful event, the great amount of experience gained was used to make
    this year's tournament even better. This year we also worked to upgrade our
    event to the standards of an official FIRST event. We also continued to send
    volunteers to help referee and queue teams at the NYC FLL tournament in
    Riverbank State Park as well as the Queens FLL Qualifier.

    As of 2019, we helped a variety of FLL Teams in Puerto Rico. More
    specifically, we aided in programming and their project presentations. These
    four teams were the ASJ Robotigers, Knight Hackers, The LEGO Builders and
    The Robogens.

    Recently, as of 2021, we've also devised our own FLL curriculum, designed
    specifically to help new teams and their mentors get a solid foundation in
    the basics of FLL robotics and its associated activities such as the FLL
    research project. The folder for these resources can be found <a
