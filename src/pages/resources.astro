      <h3>Stuy Splash</h3>
      <p>
        Stuy Splash is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the
        foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight. Stuy
        Splash was originally adapted from the beta seminar that StuyPulse has given
        as a summary of beta testing for the past several years. We very much enjoy
        providing the beta seminar, but in 2012 we realized that we had much more
        information to impart to newer teams and as a result Stuy Splash was
        founded. </p>
      <p>Modeled after the wildly successful CSplash and MIT Splash events,
        Stuy Splash is designed to aid newer teams in whatever area they are having
        trouble. A set of classes on a variety of topics from game-piece
        manipulators to marketing strategies to rationalizing your team's
        decision-making process are held throughout the day with multiple
        simultaneous classes and no requirement to sit through an entire lecture
        ensure that the learners are engaged in precisely what they want to learn
        about. And, of course, the beta seminar is offered as part of the day's
        lectures.
